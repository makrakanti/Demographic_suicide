The specific datasets (.csv files starting with “beta” or "varvov" - gg=golem grad, ks=konjsko) include betas and variance covariance matrices of the annual capture probabilities extracted for tortoises from the time-specific versions of the best-fit models estimating survival and capture probabilities. The data were generated to estimate populations sizes, and adult and operational sex ratios in the three localities (Plateau, Beach and Konjsko). Analyses performed in R (script included - "script_popsize.R").

"M_F_loc.csv" contains data on estimated annual male and female population sizes in the three populations. Analyses performed in R to check for differences in adult sex ratio between localities using a generalized binomial linear model with the full script in "script_SR.r".
